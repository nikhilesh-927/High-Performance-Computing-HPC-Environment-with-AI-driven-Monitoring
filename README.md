# High-Performance Computing (HPC) Environment with AI-Driven Monitoring

## Overview
AI-Driven HPC Monitor is an intelligent observability platform for high-performance computing clusters. It leverages machine learning to predict failures, optimize resource allocation, and provide real-time insights into system health and performance.

## Key Features
- **Predictive Analytics**: ML models forecast hardware failures and performance bottlenecks
- **Automated Anomaly Detection**: Identifies abnormal behavior in compute/storage/network subsystems
- **Resource Optimization**: Recommends workload placement using reinforcement learning
- **Unified Dashboard**: Real-time metrics visualization (CPU/GPU/memory/network utilization)
- **Alert Manager**: Context-aware notifications with Slack/PagerDuty integration
